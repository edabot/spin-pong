# Spin Pong

![pong]

[pong]: ./images/pong.gif

A variation on the classic game of Pong where the paddles can give the ball a spin. This makes the ball arc across the playfield and have a different bounce off of the walls.

Unlike the original Pong, the paddles can move past the edge of the field. This is to give players more options when the ball moves towards the corner.

Control is done with a mouse and as such is single-player only. The faster the paddle is moving when the ball hits it, the more spin it gives the ball.

The game can be played [here](http://edabot.github.io/).
